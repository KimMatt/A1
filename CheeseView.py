"""
CheeseView: A visible Cheese.

CheeseView objects are Cheese objects with a visible representation.

Each instance receives a Canvas instance. The Canvas class is a class in the
tkinter framework. The class is used for a place in a window to draw shapes.

CheeseView objects draw themselves as rectangles on the canvas, to represent
side views of rounds of cheese with particular sizes. They can be moved and
highlighted.

CheeseView objects also receive a function to call to report back to a
controller object that the their rectangle was clicked on.
